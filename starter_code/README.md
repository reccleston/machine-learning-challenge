## Models

### Support Vector Machine using a linear kernel

Classifying exoplanets using a support vector machine using a linear kernel resulted in (fruitful) results. The model was hypertuned to use C = 50, producing an accuracy of 88%. This appears to be a fair result considering the training period rather brief, 73.5 seconds in total.
